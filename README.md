Users have the flexibility to choose their preferred menu items and even have the option to customize their selection. By clicking the "Add More" button, a convenient popup form appears, allowing users to add additional items to their order seamlessly. Our primary focus has been refining the homepage's design and functionality to ensure a user-friendly experience.

We intentionally excluded more complex features such as detailed information, categorization, and login/sign-up functionalities. This deliberate decision was made to streamline the user interface and concentrate efforts on perfecting the core functionality of the home page and item selection process.

We aim to provide users with a straightforward and efficient platform for selecting menu items and enhancing their experience by allowing customization through the easy-to-use "Add More" feature. We are open to further refinements to meet your expectations if you have any specific suggestions or modifications.
